# tonkotsukatsubot
Reddit Bot that corrects submitters and commenters on /r/ramen that they had tonkOtsu broth rather than tonkAtsu

## Dependencies:

* Python 3.6 (probably? because this is my first ever python script, I'm not sure yet)
* Reddit API: [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Reddit App (just follow the instructions in the praw quickstart guide)

## Then what

Then just run the script, and watch the "Good bot!s" karma roll in.
